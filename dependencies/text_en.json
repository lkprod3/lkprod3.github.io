Having begun using a number of different software for editing audio and video around the age of 12, this subject easily caught my interest.<br>Since then, I've become proficient in software such as Vegas Pro, Premiere and After Effects, and I'm currently looking for career opportunities that not only make use of my current knowledge and skills in this area, but that also drive me to learn more.<br><br>Despite already having a profile on Behance, I've decided to write this website from scratch so that I could focus on what I believed represented me the best.<br>You can also check out my other profiles on the footer below."
